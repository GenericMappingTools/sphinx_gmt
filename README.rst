Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're not ready
to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good enough to
contribute. What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equality important contributions include: writing or proof-reading documentation,
suggesting or implementing tests, or even giving feedback about the project (including
giving feedback about the contribution process). If you're coming to the project with
fresh eyes, you might see the errors and assumptions that seasoned contributors have
glossed over. If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those
mistakes. That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
